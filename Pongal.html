    <h2>A festival of Farmers</h2>
    <p>The principal theme of Pongal is thanking the Sun god Surya, the forces of nature and the farm animals and people who support agriculture. The festival is mentioned in an inscription in Viraraghava temple attributed to Chola king Kulottunga I (1070–1122 CE) which describes a grant of land to the temple for celebrating the annual Pongal festivities.[30]
        <br> The 9th-century Shiva bhakti text Thiruvembavai by Manikkavasagar vividly mentions the festival.[30]

        The history of the Pongal dish in festive <img src="IMG-20231120-WA0012.jpg" alt="">and religious context can be traced to at least the Chola period. It appears in numerous texts and inscriptions with variant spellings. In early records, it appears as ponakam, tiruponakam, ponkal and similar terms.[31]
        <br> Temple inscriptions from Chola period to Vijayanagara period detail recipes similar to pongal <img src="IMG-20231120-WA0033.jpg" alt="">recipes of the modern era with variations in seasonings and relative amounts of the ingredients.[31]

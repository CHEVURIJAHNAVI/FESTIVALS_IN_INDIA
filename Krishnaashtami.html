<p>Krishna Janmashtami (Sanskrit: कृष्णजन्माष्टमी, romanized: Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭamī), also known simply as Krishnashtami, Janmashtami, or Gokulashtami, is an annual <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0014.jpg" alt=""> Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0010.jpg" alt=""> the eighth avatar of Vishnu. <br> <br> In certain Hindu texts, such as the Gita Govinda, Krishna has been identified as supreme God and the source of all avatars.[5] Krishna's birth is celebrated and observed on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in Shravana Masa (according to the amanta tradition) or Bhadrapada Masa (according to the purnimanta tradition). <br>This overlaps with August or September of the Gregorian calendar.[5]

    It is an important festival, particularly in the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism.[6] <br> The celebratory customs associated with Janmashtami include a celebration festival, <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0006.jpg" alt=""> reading and recitation of religious texts, dance and enactments of the life of Krishna according to the Bhagavata Purana, devotional singing till midnight (the time of Krishna's birth), and fasting (upavasa), amongst other things.[7] <br><br>It is widely celebrated across India and abroad.Krishna Janmashtami holds significant importance to Hindus around the world, and it is celebrated in diverse forms depending on their regional and cultural customs.[16][6] <br>
    <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0003.jpg" > Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and visiting Krishna or Vishnu temples. The places of Mathura and Vrindavan are visited by pilgrims.[8] Some mandirs organize recitation of Bhagavad Gita in the days leading up to Janmashtami.[17] <br>
    <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0004.jpg" > Many northern Indian communities organize dance-drama events called Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila.[14] The tradition of Rasa Lila is particularly popular in the Mathura region, in <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0011.jpg" alt="">northeastern states of India such as Manipur and Assam, and in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. <br> <br> It is acted out by numerous teams of amateur artists, cheered on by their local communities, <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0008.jpg" alt=""> and these drama-dance plays begin a few days before each Janmashtami.[18][19] <br> <img src="" >People decorate their houses with flowers and light.[20] On this day, people chant "Hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna- Krishna Hare Hare". The Janmashtami celebration is followed by Dahi Handi, which is celebrated the next day.[21][22] <br><br>

    After Krishna's midnight hour birth, forms of baby Krishna are bathed and clothed, then placed in a cradle. The devotees then break their fast by sharing food and sweets. <img src="IMG-20231213-WA0009.jpg" alt=""> <br> Women draw tiny footprints outside their house doors and kitchen, walking towards their house, a symbolism for Krishna's journey into their homes.[14]</p>
